# DVC Internal Files - Git Ignore
# =============================================================================
# These files are managed by DVC and should not be tracked by Git.
# The config file IS tracked to ensure consistent remote configuration.
#
# IMPORTANT: dvc.lock (at project root) must be tracked in Git for reproducibility!
# This file only ignores internal .dvc directory contents.
