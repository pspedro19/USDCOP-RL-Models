# =============================================================================
# Forecasting Experiment: Oil + VIX Features V1
# =============================================================================
#
# Hypothesis: Adding oil price momentum and VIX volatility features
# improves direction accuracy for USDCOP prediction.
#
# Rationale:
# - Oil (Brent/WTI) is correlated with Colombian peso (petro-currency)
# - VIX indicates market risk appetite affecting EM currencies
#
# SSOT Contract: CTR-FORECAST-EXPERIMENT-CONFIG-001
# Version: 1.0.0
