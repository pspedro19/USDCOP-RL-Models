ANNUALIZED CAPITAL PROJECTIONS (12-month)
===============================================================================

Starting Capital: $10,000

Scenario                    Pessimistic  Base Case   Optimistic  % Chance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current (extrapolated)      $5,950       $7,300      $8,110      10% (unrealistic)
Moderate (Cost + Signal)    $10,700      $11,000     $11,500      40% (achievable in 6mo)
Target (Full Stack)         $11,750      $12,500     $13,750      30% (realistic 12-month)
Optimistic (Best-in-class)  $12,940      $14,200     $16,300       5% (requires perfection)


SENSITIVITY: Cost Impact (keeping signal at $28.46)
===============================================================================

Round-Trip Cost  | 88-day Return | APY      | Comment
-------------------------------------------
30 bps          | -0.34%        | -1.40%   | Institutional rates (hard to get)
50 bps          | -4.74%        | -19.59%  | Prime brokerage target
75 bps          | -10.24%       | -42.32%  | (Current path)
90 bps          | -13.54%       | -55.96%  | CURRENT SYSTEM - UNSUSTAINABLE
125 bps         | -21.24%       | -87.79%  | Worst-case retail (disaster)

KEY: Every 10 bps cost reduction adds ~2-3% APY


SENSITIVITY: Signal Quality Impact (at 50 bps costs)
===============================================================================

Avg Trade PnL | 88-day Return | APY      | Feasibility
-------------------------------------------------
$20.00        | -6.60%        | -27.28%  | Current underperformance
$28.46        | -4.74%        | -19.59%  | Current level
$40.00        | -2.20%        | -9.09%   | +40% improvement
$50.00        | 0.00%         | 0.00%    | BREAK-EVEN point
$60.00        | 2.20%         | 9.09%    | +110% improvement (TARGET)
$75.00        | 5.50%         | 22.73%   | +160% improvement (OPTIMISTIC)

KEY: Every $10 increase in avg trade adds ~7-8% APY


BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS
===============================================================================

Question 1: How many trades per year can we sustain at 0.9% cost?
Answer:    91 trades/year (0.25 trades/day)
           Annual gross profit: $2,589
           Annual costs: $8,185
           Annual net: -$5,596 (UNSUSTAINABLE)

Question 2: What cost threshold makes the system break-even?
Answer:    Current $28.46 avg trade requires 14.2 bps round-trip cost
           Reality: Retail = 90+ bps, Prime = 35-50 bps, Institutional = 15 bps
           => Need to EITHER improve signal $28 -> $50 OR reduce costs 90 -> 50 bps

Question 3: What's the cost for 10% APY with 91 annual trades?
Answer:    50 bps round-trip (achievable with prime brokerage)
           But ONLY if we improve signal quality to $40-45 avg trade


IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (90-DAY PATH)
===============================================================================

Phase 1 (Days 1-30): COST REDUCTION
  Target: Reduce from 90 to 50 bps via prime brokerage
  Expected: -28% APY -> -19% APY (partial improvement)
  Effort: LOW | Impact: +9% APY improvement | Priority: CRITICAL

Phase 2 (Days 15-45): SIGNAL ENHANCEMENT
  Target: Improve avg trade PnL from $28 to $45 (+58%)
  Methods: Better features, macro regime filtering, improved exits
  Expected: -19% APY -> -5% APY
  Effort: MEDIUM | Impact: +14% APY improvement | Priority: HIGH

Phase 3 (Days 30-60): TRADE FILTERING
  Target: Select top 80% conviction trades (18/22)
  Methods: Confidence scoring, regime compatibility checks
  Expected: -5% APY -> +5% APY
  Effort: LOW | Impact: +10% APY improvement | Priority: HIGH

Phase 4 (Days 60-90): VALIDATION & PRODUCTION READINESS
  Target: Validate on full 12-month data, fine-tune parameters
  Expected: Achieve +15-25% APY sustainably
  Effort: MEDIUM | Impact: Verification | Priority: ESSENTIAL


CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
===============================================================================

1. COST REDUCTION IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
   - Current 90 bps is terminal for this system
   - Target: 50 bps via prime brokerage (achievable at $10k AUM)
   - Without this: System cannot be profitable

2. SIGNAL QUALITY MUST IMPROVE
   - Current $28.46 avg trade is too low
   - Target: $45-60 avg trade PnL (76-110% improvement)
   - Methods: Better features, regime detection, macro integration
   - Without this: Cost reduction alone insufficient

3. TRADE SELECTION IS IMPORTANT
   - Filter to 80-90% conviction trades
   - Trade quantity reduction (22 -> 18) is acceptable if quality improves
   - Without this: Marginal gains only

MUST COMBINE ALL THREE:
- Cost reduction alone: -19% APY (FAIL)
- Signal improvement alone: -31% APY (FAIL)
- Trade filtering alone: -44% APY (FAIL)
- All three combined: +18% APY (SUCCESS) ✓


RISK ASSESSMENT
===============================================================================

Risk                          | Probability | Impact   | Mitigation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Signal improvement fails      | 40%         | MEDIUM   | Phased rollout, A/B testing
Cost negotiation fails        | 30%         | MEDIUM   | Start at 75 bps (still helps)
Backtest overfitting          | 60%         | HIGH     | Validate on 2024-2025 data
Banrep/macro intervention     | 20%         | CRITICAL | Keep drawdown checks, hedge
Market regime shift           | 25%         | HIGH     | Robust reward penalties
Account too small for rates   | 15%         | MEDIUM   | Negotiate or scale account


FINANCIAL TARGETS
===============================================================================

Minimum Acceptable:  +10% APY (requires 50 bps + $40 avg trade)
Target:             +18% APY (requires 35 bps + $60 avg trade + 18 trades)
Optimistic:         +37% APY (requires 30 bps + $75 avg trade + 20 trades)

12-Month Capital at Target: $12,500 (25% gain on $10,000)
12-Month Capital at Optimistic: $14,200 (42% gain on $10,000)


IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 30 Days)
===============================================================================

[ ] ACTION 1: Benchmark prime brokerage rates
    - Contact: Saxo Bank, Interactive Brokers, Oanda Prime
    - Target: Get quotes for 75 USD/COP position size
    - Goal: Confirm 50 bps round-trip achievable

[ ] ACTION 2: Begin signal enhancement analysis
    - Analyze trade profit distribution (what made winners winners?)
    - Identify regime characteristics of best trades
    - Design 3-5 new features for macro regime detection

[ ] ACTION 3: Implement confidence scoring system
    - Add signal strength metrics to trade decision logic
    - Define threshold for "high-conviction" trades (target: 80%+ confidence)
    - Test on historical data: does filtering improve quality?

[ ] ACTION 4: Plan validation dataset
    - Secure 12-month out-of-sample data (Jan 2025 - Dec 2025)
    - Set up backtesting infrastructure
    - Define success criteria before implementation


BOTTOM LINE
===============================================================================

The USD/COP RL system generates PROFITABLE SIGNALS (+$28.46/trade) but is
COST-CONSTRAINED (90 bps destroys 19.8% of capital).

CURRENT STATUS:        -55.96% APY (UNACCEPTABLE)
WITH IMPROVEMENTS:     +18.60% APY (ACCEPTABLE, achievable in 90 days)
BEST CASE:             +37.20% APY (EXCELLENT, requires maximum effort)

THREE-PRONGED SOLUTION REQUIRED:
1. Reduce costs from 90 to 35 bps (via prime brokerage)
2. Improve signal from $28 to $60 avg trade (via better features)
3. Filter to 18 high-quality trades (via conviction scoring)

Estimated Timeline: 90 days to production with +18% APY
Resources Required: Prime brokerage negotiation + signal engineering work
Confidence Level: 70% (conditional on cost reduction succeeding)
