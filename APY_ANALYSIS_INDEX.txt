KEY TAKEAWAYS (MEMORIZE THESE)
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE:
  - 22 trades × $28.46 avg = $625 gross profit
  - 22 trades × $90 cost = $1,980 total costs
  - Net: -$1,354 (-13.54% in 88 days, -55.96% annualized)
  - PROBLEM: Costs 3.5x the profit per trade

TARGET STATE:
  - 18 trades × $60 avg = $1,080 gross profit
  - 18 trades × $35 cost = $630 total costs
  - Net: +$450 (+4.50% in 88 days, +18.60% annualized)
  - SOLUTION: Better signal + lower costs = profitability

REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS (ALL THREE):
  1. Costs: 90 → 35 bps (reduce by 61%)
  2. Signal: $28 → $60 (improve by 110%)
  3. Trades: 22 → 18 (filter to 82% quality)

TIMELINE:
  - Phase 1 (Cost): 30 days → -19% APY
  - Phase 2 (Signal): 45 days → -5% APY
  - Phase 3 (Filter): 60 days → +5% APY
  - Phase 4 (Validate): 90 days → +18% APY

CAPITAL PROJECTION:
  - Current path: $7,300 at 12 months (-27%)
  - Target path: $12,500 at 12 months (+25%)
  - Difference: $5,200 recovery (70% improvement)

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

UNDERSTANDING:
  [ ] What is the current APY? (-55.96%)

  [ ] Why can't we just reduce costs? (Signal quality insufficient)
  [ ] Why can't we just improve signal? (Costs still unaffordable)

DECISION:
  [ ] Is Phase 1 (cost reduction) worth starting? (YES)
  [ ] Is the 90-day timeline realistic? (YES, with focus)
  [ ] Is 18.6% APY a good target? (YES, achievable)
  [ ] What could go wrong? (See risk section in EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY)
  [ ] How much staff time required? (200 hours = 1.3 FTE for 3 months)

ACTION:
  [ ] Schedule Phase 1 kickoff meeting
  [ ] Assign broker relationship lead
