## What is L2?

**L2 Prepare** is the data cleaning layer that transforms L1 standardized data into ML-ready features:

1. **Winsorization** - Remove extreme returns using 4-sigma MAD-based clipping
2. **Deseasonalization** - Remove HOD (hour-of-day) patterns using robust z-score
3. **Normalization** - Scale features to 0-2 range
4. **Quality Gating** - Produce STRICT (60/60 episodes) and FLEX (59/60 padded) variants

**Input**: L1 standardized data (55K rows, 929 episodes)
**Output**: ML-ready features (14.7K rows STRICT, 15K rows FLEX)

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/pipeline/l2/prepared
Returns quality metrics and gate status:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "quality_metrics": {
    "winsorization_rate_pct": 0.65,
    "hod_median_abs": 0.002,

    "flex": { "episodes": 250, "rows": 15000 }
  },
  "quality_gates": { ... },
  "pass": true
}
```

### GET /api/pipeline/l2/contract
Returns schema, variants, required columns, technical indicator list

### GET /api/pipeline/l2/indicators
Returns sample data with all 67 indicators

---

## Quality Gates (Critical)

### Hard Stop Gates (ALL must pass)
1. `winsor_rate_pct <= 1.0%` - Max clipping rate
2. `hod_median_abs <= 0.05` - Median returns near zero
3. `hod_mad_range ∈ [0.8, 1.2]` - Scale stability
4. `ret_deseason_std ∈ [0.8, 1.2]` - Unit variance requirement

### Warning Gates (Monitor)
5. `nan_rate_pct <= 0.5%` - Missing values
6. `ohlc_violations == 0` - Data integrity
7. `stale_rate_pct <= 2.0%` - No stale data

---

## L3 Integration

L3 Feature Engineering expects:
- **Min 100 episodes** (guaranteed: STRICT has 245+)
- **No NaNs** in STRICT variant (guaranteed: < 0.2%)
- **Normalized returns** with unit variance (guaranteed: 0.98±0.12)
- **Normalized volatility** in 0-2 scale (guaranteed: range_norm)
- **Episode boundaries** clearly marked (guaranteed: episode_id, t_in_episode)

L2 guarantees all these requirements are met and quality gates are passed.

## Generated Reports (in MinIO)

1. **quality_metrics.json** - Aggregated statistics
2. **dq_counts_daily.csv** - Per-episode counts
3. **outlier_report.csv** - Outlier details
4. **coverage_report.json** - Lineage tracking
5. **episode_quality.csv** - Quality flags per episode

All stored with manifest tracking for reproducibility.

## Key Formulas

### Winsorization (4-sigma MAD-based)
```
For each hour:
  scale = max(
    1.4826 × MAD,
    (Q75 - Q25) / 1.349,
    floor (8.5-10.0 bps)
  )
  threshold = median ± 4.0 × scale
  clipped = clip(return, threshold_lo, threshold_hi)
```

### Deseasonalization (Robust z-score)
```
deseason = (clipped - hod_median) / scale
Target: mean ≈ 0, std ≈ 1.0
```

### Range Normalization
```
range_bps = (high - low) / close × 10000
range_norm = range_bps / p95_range_per_hour
Typical: 0-1 (normalized to p95)
```

### ATR (14-period EMA)
```
TR = max(H-L, |H-Close_prev|, |L-Close_prev|)
ATR = EMA(TR, period=14, reset at episode boundaries)
atr_norm = ATR / close × 10000
```

---

## Episode Quality Tiers

```
PERFECT   → 60/60 bars, 0 stale, 0 winsor
OK        → 60/60 bars, stale <= 1%, winsor <= 0.5%
WARN      → 60/60 bars, stale <= 2%, winsor <= 1%
MARGINAL  → Anything worse than WARN
```

**Typical Distribution**: 69% PERFECT + 20% OK + 8% WARN + 3% MARGINAL
**Healthy Threshold**: >= 80% PERFECT+OK
