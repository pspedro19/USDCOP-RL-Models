description: "Market signals → daily digest delivered before market open. Scans watchlist tickers for regime changes, technical setups, options flow anomalies, and IBKR position health — then delivers a prioritized action list. No IBKR distraction during 50-call BDR days. Use when: 'market digest', 'trading alerts', 'pre-market scan', 'watchlist check', 'what's setting up', 'trading morning brief', 'market open prep'."
---

<objective>
Eliminate real-time market monitoring during BDR work hours. Scan Tim's watchlist and IBKR positions once daily before market open, identify actionable setups using the trading-signals framework, and deliver a single prioritized digest. No intraday distractions — just one morning read that surfaces what matters.

Target: 30 min/day saved + fewer missed setups from not watching screens during 50-call days.
</objective>

<quick_start>
**Daily automated run (7am CST / 8am EST — 1.5 hrs before market open):**
Scheduled task scans all watchlist tickers + open positions → delivers digest

**On-demand:**
"market digest" → runs full scan now
"what's setting up" → filtered to high-conviction setups only
"check my positions" → IBKR portfolio health only

**Trigger phrases:**
- "market digest" / "trading alerts" / "pre-market scan"
- "watchlist check" / "what's setting up"
- "trading morning brief" / "market open prep"
- "check my positions" / "position health"
</quick_start>

<success_criteria>
- All watchlist tickers scanned with regime + technical analysis
- Open IBKR positions checked for risk/expiry/Greeks health
- High-conviction setups (confluence ≥ 0.7) surfaced at top
- Position risk alerts flagged (approaching max loss, expiry, assignment risk)
- Digest scannable in under 3 minutes
- No intraday interruptions — one daily read covers everything
- Missed setup rate reduced vs manual checking
</success_criteria>

## Architecture

```
SCHEDULED (7am CST)          ANALYSIS                       OUTPUT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Watchlist tickers     →  Regime detection (Markov)    →  Daily Digest
IBKR open positions   →  Technical scan (5 methods)   →  Action List
Market internals      →  Options flow anomalies       →  Position Alerts
Economic calendar     →  Greeks/risk check positions   →  Risk Dashboard
```

## Stage 1: Data Collection

### 1a. Watchlist Tickers
Tim's default watchlist (update in `reference/watchlist.json`):

**Core positions:** SPY, QQQ, IWM, TLT, GLD, SLV, USO, VIX
**Individual stocks:** AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, AMZN, META, GOOG, AMD, PLTR, COIN
**Crypto proxies:** BITO, MSTR
**Sector ETFs:** XLF, XLE, XLK, ARKK, SMH

For each ticker, use web search to pull:
- Current price + pre-market move
- 5-day price action summary
- Volume vs average
- Key support/resistance levels
- Any overnight news/catalysts

### 1b. IBKR Portfolio Positions
Use IBKR MCP server tools (`ArjunDivecha/ibkr-mcp-server`, installed at `~/Desktop/tk_projects/ibkr-mcp-server/`):

| Tool | Data Pulled |
|------|------------|
| `get_portfolio` | All open positions + P&L across accounts (Roth IRA, personal brokerage, THK Enterprises) |
| `get_account_summary` | Balances, margin utilization, buying power, cash available |
| `switch_account` | Toggle between accounts for per-account view |
| `get_margin_requirements` | Current margin needs per position |

**Prerequisites:** IB Gateway must be running on port 7497 (paper) or 7496 (live).
**If IBKR not connected:** Skip this section — web search covers market data. Portfolio section shows "IBKR not connected — start IB Gateway to enable portfolio checks."

### 1c. Market Internals
Web search for:
- S&P 500 advance/decline
- VIX level + term structure (contango/backwardation)
- Put/call ratio
- 10Y Treasury yield
- DXY (dollar index)
- Fed funds futures (rate expectations)
- Economic calendar events for today

## Stage 2: Analysis (Using trading-signals Framework)

### 2a. Regime Detection
For SPY (market proxy), run Markov 7-state regime model:

| State | Description | Strategy Bias |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 0 | Strong bull | Long bias, sell puts |
| 1 | Moderate bull | Long bias, covered calls |
| 2 | Weak bull / consolidation | Neutral, iron condors |
| 3 | Transition / chop | Reduce size, wait |
| 4 | Weak bear | Hedge, reduce long |
| 5 | Moderate bear | Short bias, buy puts |
| 6 | Crash / high vol | Protection mode, VIX plays |

### 2b. Per-Ticker Technical Scan
For each watchlist ticker, score on 5 methodologies:

| Method | Signal | Weight (regime-adjusted) |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| Elliott Wave | Wave position + projected target | 20-30% |
| Wyckoff | Accumulation/distribution phase | 15-25% |
| Fibonacci | Key retracement/extension levels | 15-20% |
| Turtle | Donchian breakout signals | 10-20% |
| Markov Regime | Regime-appropriate strategy | 20-30% |

**Confluence Score:** Weighted average across methods
- ≥ 0.7: **HIGH** — Flag as actionable setup
- 0.4-0.7: **MODERATE** — Watch list, note trigger level
- < 0.4: **LOW** — No action, skip from digest

### 2c. Options Flow Scan
For tickers with options positions or high confluence:
- Unusual volume (>2x avg) on specific strikes
- Put/call ratio shifts
- Implied volatility rank (IVR) — is premium rich or cheap?
- Earnings dates within 14 days

### 2d. Position Health Check
For each open IBKR position (via `get_portfolio` + `get_account_summary`):

| Check | Alert Threshold |
|-------|----------------|
| Days to expiry | < 7 DTE on options → ROLL/CLOSE decision |
| Delta exposure | Portfolio delta > ±50 → hedge needed |
| Max loss approaching | Position down > 50% of max loss → manage |
| Assignment risk | ITM short options near expiry → close or roll |
| Theta decay | Positive theta across portfolio? |
| Margin utilization | > 50% → reduce risk |
| Concentrated position | Any single position > 15% of portfolio → flag |

## Rules
- **No intraday alerts.** This runs ONCE at 7am. Tim checks it, makes decisions, then focuses on BDR work.
- **Actionable only.** Don't list 30 tickers with "neutral" signals. Only surface what needs attention.
- **Position management first.** Alerts on existing positions before new setups.
- **Risk management always.** Every setup includes stop loss. Portfolio delta/margin always visible.
- **2% rule enforced.** Flag if any suggested trade exceeds 2% portfolio risk.
- **15% concentration rule.** Flag if any position exceeds 15% of account.

## Emit Outcome Sidecar

As the final step, write to `~/.claude/skill-analytics/last-outcome-trading-alert-scheduler.json`:
```json
{"ts":"[UTC ISO8601]","skill":"trading-alert-scheduler","version":"1.0.0","variant":"default",
 "status":"[success|partial|error]","runtime_ms":[estimated ms from start],
 "metrics":{"alerts_generated":[n],"tickers_scanned":[n],"regime_changes":[n]},
 "error":null,"session_id":"[YYYY-MM-DD]"}
```
Use status "partial" if some stages failed but results were produced. Use "error" only if no output was generated.
