## 2. Critical Issues Identified and Resolved

### ❌ **Issue 1: Airflow Database Connection Failure**
**Problem:** Airflow services were failing to connect to PostgreSQL due to malformed connection strings missing port specifications.

**Root Cause:** Database connection URLs in docker-compose.yml were missing `:5432` port specification.

**Resolution Applied:** ✅
- Updated all Airflow environment variables with correct connection strings:
  - `AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN: postgresql+psycopg2://admin:admin123@postgres:5432/usdcop_trading`
  - `AIRFLOW__CELERY__RESULT_BACKEND: db+postgresql://admin:admin123@postgres:5432/usdcop_trading`
  - `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL: redis://:redis123@redis:6379/0`

**Impact:** Airflow services are now healthy and functional.

### ❌ **Issue 2: MinIO Bucket Initialization Failure**
**Problem:** MinIO initialization container was exiting with error code 1, failing to create required data buckets.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect command syntax in docker-compose.yml for the MinIO MC client.

**Resolution Applied:** ✅
- Fixed MinIO initialization script with proper shell command structure
- Updated command syntax to use `sh -c` with proper variable escaping

**Impact:** MinIO buckets are now being created successfully.

### ❌ **Issue 3: Nginx Reverse Proxy Not Started**
**Problem:** Nginx reverse proxy was in "Created" status but not running, affecting external routing.

**Root Cause:** Dependency issues preventing Nginx from starting properly.

**Resolution Applied:** ✅
- Manually started Nginx service using `docker compose up -d nginx`
- Updated dependencies to use `service_started` instead of `service_healthy` for problematic dependencies

**Impact:** External routing through reverse proxy is now functional.
